# 🚀 Quick Setup Guide

## ✅ Project Status

**Everything is working correctly!** ✨

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: Clean
- ✅ Next.js build: Successful  
- ✅ ESLint: No errors or warnings
- ✅ Package dependencies: Installed with pnpm
- ✅ Mock integrations: Ready for development

## 🛠️ Next Steps

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your actual credentials:

```env
# Required for production (currently using mock data)
CDP_API_KEY_NAME="your-cdp-api-key"
CDP_PRIVATE_KEY="your-cdp-private-key"
X402_WALLET_ADDRESS="your-x402-wallet"
X402_PRIVATE_KEY="your-x402-private-key"
JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"
ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-32-byte-encryption-key"

# Optional: Amazon Bedrock (for bonus features)
AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-key"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-aws-secret"
```

### 2. Start Development

```bash
# Start both dashboard and MCP server
pnpm run demo

# Or start individually:
pnpm run dev        # Dashboard at http://localhost:3000
pnpm run mcp:dev    # MCP Server at port 3001
```

### 3. View the Dashboard

Open http://localhost:3000 to see:
- 📊 Real-time revenue metrics
- 💰 Wallet management interface  
- 🔧 Tool configuration dashboard
- 🎬 Payment flow demonstration

## 🔧 Development Mode Features

The project includes smart **mock implementations** for development:

- **CDP Wallet**: Simulated transactions and balances
- **x402 Payment**: Mock payment verification
- **MCP Server**: Functional tool execution without real payments
- **Dashboard**: Realistic demo data and charts

This allows you to:
- ✅ Develop and test the UI immediately
- ✅ Demo the complete payment flow
- ✅ Build new features without external dependencies
- ✅ Configure real integrations when ready

## 🏆 Hackathon Ready

This template is **completely ready** for hackathon submission:

1. **Working Demo**: Full UI and payment flow simulation
2. **Real Integration**: Switch to production by configuring `.env`
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and examples
4. **Video Script**: Ready for demo recording
5. **Production Build**: Deployable to any platform

## 🎯 Testing the Demo

Try these commands to see everything working:

```bash
# Check code quality
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run build

# Start the demo
pnpm run demo
```

## 💡 Key Features to Highlight

When demoing to judges, emphasize:

- **Complete Payment Loop**: Revenue in → payment out
- **Real-World Application**: Solves actual MCP monetization  
- **Composable Architecture**: Easy to extend and customize
- **Beautiful UI**: Professional dashboard design
- **Multiple Examples**: AI marketplace, bounty bot, micro-SaaS
- **Optional Bedrock**: Bonus AWS integration
- **Production Ready**: Full deployment configuration

## 🎬 Demo Video

Follow the script in `demo-video.md` to create an impressive presentation showing:
1. Dashboard overview with live metrics
2. MCP server with payment verification
3. Complete payment flow demonstration
4. Real-world use case examples
5. Amazon Bedrock integration
