- Submit payment and retry ‚Üí successful response
- Show revenue distribution in real-time

### Section 4: Real-World Examples (1.5 minutes)
**Visual**: Quick demos of the example applications
**Narrator**:
> "We've built compelling real-world examples that demonstrate the power of this infrastructure."

**Show**:
- **AI Agent Marketplace**: Multiple AI agents with different pricing, automatic revenue sharing between creators and contributors
- **Bounty Board Bot**: Automated bounty system that collects entry fees and distributes prizes to winners
- **Micro-SaaS API**: Gated access with affiliate revenue splits

### Section 5: Amazon Bedrock Integration (45 seconds)
